# TGx-GAN: Inferencing Transcriptomic Profile from Chemical Information in Toxicogenomics using Artificial Intelligence
In vivo Toxicogenomics (TGx) has been widely applied in the toxicology field. However, profiling transcriptomic profiles treated with thousands of compounds on hundreds of thousands of animals are very expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Herein, we proposed an AI-powered TGx-based deep generative adversarial network (GAN) model named TGx-GAN to infer rat liver transcriptomic profiles in the Open Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System (TG-GATEs) based on chemical information only.<br>

We further exemplified the potential utilities of the proposed TGx-GAN in facilitating 28-day repeated dose toxicity studies.<br>
